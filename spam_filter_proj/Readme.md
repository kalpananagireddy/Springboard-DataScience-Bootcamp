# 1st Capstone Project

**Title:** Spam filter for Youtube comments

**Problem:** Youtube is one of the most popular video sharing platform with more than 1 billion users. Users have long been outraged by the overwhelming number of spam messages in the comment section. In 2012 users created a petition asking Youtube to provide tools to deal with undesired content. In 2013, spam problem gets worse as Google overhauled the YouTube comment system to connect it to Google+, which allows users to post links. This attracts more malicious users to self-promote their videos using the platform. This project will build a spam filter to automatically filter spam comments.

**Who might care?** Spam comments are annoying for content creators, for the users as well as platform owner. Content creators want to read about how their fans reacts to the video they created. Users want to glance through the comments to connect with other fans as well as with their favorites content creators. Platform owner want to get rid of malacious spam to make sure their platform is safe to use and provides an enjoyable experience to all end uers.

**Data:** The data is aquired from [UCI machine learning repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/YouTube+Spam+Collection). The data is collected through YouTube API and contains ~2000 comments extracted from 5 most popular videos on Youtube during the first half of 2015.

**Modeling approach:** Following machine learning models are used:
 
	*Logistic regression
	*Random Forest
	*Naive Bayes
	*SVM
